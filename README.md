# Caseta2Mqtt
A gateway to connect a Lutron Caseta Smart Bridge Pro and MQTT.

## CLI Commands
- `npm run watch` - Builds the application and watches for changes.
- `npm run build` - Builds the application for production deployment.
- `npm start` - Runs the built application.

## Development Process
To develop locally, run `npm run watch` in a command line window. After the server and client builds complete, run `npm start` in a *different* command line window.

The first process will watch the file system for changes, and rebuild when they occur. The second process will run the application, hot-swapping modules when they're rebuilt.
